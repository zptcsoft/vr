title: Using animations

sections:
  - subtitle: Start making your objects move around the screen.
    instruction: >
      I've added an animation to the box to make it rotate, like you just did.
      It's quite slow though, how would you make it faster?
      Can you also change the direction?
    before: >
      <a-box invader position="0 0 -3" rotation="0 0 0" color="orange">
    code: |
      <a-animation attribute="rotation" dur="20000" from="0 0 0" to="360 360 0"
        repeat="indefinite" easing="linear"></a-animation>
    after: >
      </a-box><a-sky color="#eee"></a-sky><a-camera user-height="0"></a-camera>
  - subtitle: Now try making your own animation.
    instruction: >
      You've managed to change the one I made for you, see if you can make your own!
      Can you change this animation to make the box go from orange to purple?
    before: >
      <a-box invader position="0 0 -3" rotation="0 0 0" color="orange"><a-animation attribute="rotation" dur="2000" from="0 0 0" to="360 360 0" repeat="indefinite" easing="linear"></a-animation>
    code: |
      <a-animation attribute="width" dur="2000" from="1" to="2"></a-animation>
    after: >
      </a-box><a-sky color="#eee"></a-sky><a-camera user-height="0"></a-camera>
